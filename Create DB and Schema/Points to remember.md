1. METADATA$FILENAME
2. METADATA$FILE_ROW_NUMBER
3. METADATA$FILE_CONTENT_KEY

5. METADATA$START_SCAN_TIME


## üîç Primary Key vs Surrogate Key

| Feature           | Primary Key                                 | Surrogate Key                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Definition        | Uniquely identifies a row using real data    | System-generated unique identifier     |
| Business Meaning  | Yes (e.g., email, SSN)                       | No (e.g., ID = 101, 102...)            |
| Changeable        | Might change if business data changes        | Never changes once assigned            |
| Readability       | Human-readable                               | Not meaningful to users                |
| Performance       | Can be slower if large or composite          | Typically faster due to simplicity     |
| Example           | email = "geedhu@example.com"                | user_id = 1001                         |


In short, every table needs a primary key, but a surrogate key can be used as the primary key when natural data isn‚Äôt reliable or stable enough.

## What will happen if the data from the stream object is not consumed using a merge statement or stored procedure
It will keep the bad records, and the merge statement will keep failing.

Solution: 

Step 1: To get rid of the bad record,  create a temporary table from the stream object as shown below:

Step 2: Delete the data from the stage_sch.location table

Step 3: Now run the stream table, as it was created with "append-only" mode, it will not contain the deleted data history.
